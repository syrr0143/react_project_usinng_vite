# context api in react

The React Context API was introduced in React version 16.3 to address the problem of prop drilling. Prop drilling is when you have to pass props down through multiple levels of components to get the data to where it needs to be. This can make your code difficult to read and maintain.

The Context API provides a way to share data between components without having to pass props down through the component tree. You can create a context object that stores the data you want to share, and then you can use the Provider and Consumer components to make the data available to any component in the tree.

This can make your code much more readable and maintainable, especially in large applications.
